#' Predict method for Mixture models
#' 
#' Performs sequential predictions and updates
#' of a mixture object based on new observations 
#' and expert advice.
#' 
#' @param object Object of class inheriting from 'mixture'
#' 
#' @param newexperts An optional matrix in which to look for expert advice with which
#' predict. If omitted, the past predictions of the object are returned and the
#' object is not updated.
#' 
#' @param newY An optional matrix with d columns (or vector if \eqn{d=1}) of observations to be predicted. If provided, it 
#' should have the same number of rows as the number of rows of \code{newexperts}.
#' If omitted, the object (i.e, the aggregation rule) is not updated.
#' 
#' @param awake An optional array specifying the
#' activation coefficients of the experts. It must have the same dimension as experts. Its entries lie in \code{[0,1]}.
#' Possible if some experts are specialists and do not always form and suggest
#' prediction. If the expert number \code{k} at instance \code{t} does not
#' form any prediction of observation \code{Y_t}, we can put
#' \code{awake[t,k]=0} so that the mixture does not consider expert \code{k} in
#' the mixture to predict \code{Y_t}.
#' 
#' @param online A boolean determining if the observations in newY are predicted
#' sequentially (by updating the object step by step) or not. If FALSE, 
#' the observations are predicting using the object (without using any past 
#' information in newY). If TRUE, newY and newexperts should not be null.
#' 
#' @param type Type of prediction. It can be 
#' \describe{
#'    \item{model}{return the updated version of object (using newY and newexperts).}
#'    \item{response}{return the forecasts. If type is 'model', forecasts can also 
#'    be obtained from the last values of object$prediction.}
#'    \item{weights}{return the weights assigned to the expert advice to 
#'    produce the forecasts. If type is 'model', forecasts can also 
#'    be obtained from the last rows of object$weights.}
#'    \item{all}{return a list containing 'model', 'response', and 'weights'.}
#'    }
#' 
#' @param quiet \code{boolean}. Whether or not to display progress bars.
#' 
#' @param ...  further arguments are ignored
#' 
#' @return \code{predict.mixture} produces a matrix of predictions 
#' (type = 'response'), an updated object (type = 'model'), or a matrix of
#' weights (type = 'weights').
